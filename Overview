The purpose of this project was to see if there was a way to do any sort of predictive modeling on Democratic 
Party Candidates and their twitter valenance/volume. 

We initially started with the major candiates but the field rapidly dropped to two, so most of the analysis was done
on Senator Sanders and former VP Biden, after the tweets were streamed via AWS (using the Tweepy Package).

Although the model did not correspond to any meaningful trends (partly because we only had a month worth of data), it 
did result in some interesting visualizatinos (created in Tableau).
